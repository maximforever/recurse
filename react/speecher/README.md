This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[Say What!?](http://saywhatgame.herokuapp.com) is a small Express/React app that fetches quotes from the [They Said So](http://quotes.rest) API and invites used to guess these. Similar to Wheel of Fortune, users can guess or buy words, and earn money for each word they guess.

# to run:

`npm install`
`npm start`
